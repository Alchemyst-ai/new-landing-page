          <h2>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2><br />

          <h3>Informal Negotiations</h3>
          <p>
              To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these
              Terms of Use (each &quot;Dispute&quot;
 and collectively, the “Disputes”) brought by either you or us
              (individually, a “Party” and collectively, the “Parties”), the Parties agree to first attempt to
              negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at
              least Forty-Five (45) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence
              upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.
          </p><br /><br />

          <h3>Binding Arbitration</h3><br />
          <p>
              Any dispute or claim under the Terms of Use shall be referred to and finally and exclusively
              resolved by arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 or any
              statutory modification or re-enactment thereof for the time being in force. The arbitration shall
              be held at West Bengal and all proceedings in any such arbitration shall be conducted in English.
              There shall be 3 (three) arbitrators (“Arbitrators”), all of whom shall be fluent in English. Within
              thirty 30 (thirty) Days of the reference of the dispute to arbitration, the Party raising the dispute
              and making the reference to arbitration shall appoint one Arbitrator and the other Party shall
              appoint the other Arbitrator. The third Arbitrator shall be appointed by the 2 (two) appointed
              Arbitrators. The arbitral award shall be final and binding upon the parties. The Parties shall equally
              bear the costs and expenses for the conduct of the arbitration proceedings, however; each Party
              shall bear their own legal expenses.
          </p><br /><br />

          <h3>Restrictions</h3><br />
          <p>
              The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties
              individually. To the full extent permitted by law, 
              <ul>
                  <li>No arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding;</li>
                  <li>There is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and</li>
                  <li>There is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.</li>
              </ul>
          </p><br /><br />

          <h3>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</h3><br />
          <p>
              The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning
              informal negotiations and binding arbitration:

                  <li>Any claim for injunctive relief.</li>
              </ul>

              any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and
              such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for
